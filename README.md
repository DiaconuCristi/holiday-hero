# holiday-hero
Are you too busy for social interaction during the holidays? Or just too lazy? Rest assured, the Holiday-Hero has got your back!
Holiday-Hero uses millitary grade coding (not really) to get *you*, yes *you*, the person reading this, out of awkward conversations!
Holiday-Hero detects if the current day is a holiday, and sends a message to your contacts on Whatsapp wishing them all the best, so that you don't have to pretend to care!
It's jolly automation!
